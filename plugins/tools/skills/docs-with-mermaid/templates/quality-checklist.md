# Documentation Quality Checklist

Before finalizing documentation, verify each item:

## Diagrams

- [ ] **Diagrams render correctly** in target platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- [ ] **Labels are clear** and don't use unexplained abbreviations
- [ ] **Flow direction is logical** and easy to follow
- [ ] **Color is accessible** (not relying on color alone for meaning)
- [ ] **Diagrams have context** - prose explains what the diagram shows
- [ ] **Level of detail is appropriate** for the audience
- [ ] **Diagrams are not overcrowded** - split complex diagrams into focused ones
- [ ] **All entities in diagrams are explained** in the text

## Content

- [ ] **Overview explains WHY** before WHAT and HOW
- [ ] **Information is layered** - high-level first, then details
- [ ] **Key concepts are defined** before being used
- [ ] **Code examples are included** where relevant
- [ ] **No orphaned diagrams** - every diagram is introduced and explained

## Structure

- [ ] **Document follows a logical progression** (overview → details → reference)
- [ ] **Headings create scannable hierarchy**
- [ ] **Table of contents** is present for long documents
- [ ] **Cross-references** link to related documentation

## Accuracy

- [ ] **Diagrams match current codebase** (not outdated)
- [ ] **All Mermaid syntax is valid** and tested
- [ ] **Technical details are correct** (verified against source code)
- [ ] **No placeholder content** remains
